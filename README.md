üö® Disclaimer Regarding Test Execution

This repository contains automated test scripts designed for educational and demonstration purposes only. Please note:

1. Udemy's Anti-Automation Measures

        - Udemy actively blocks automated interactions with their platform.

        - Their website employs bot detection systems (e.g., Cloudflare, CAPTCHAs, IP rate-limiting) that may prevent these scripts from running successfully.

2. No Guarantee of Functionality

        - The source code is provided "as-is" and may no longer work due to changes in:

                Udemy's UI structure (element selectors may break)

                Authentication flows (login/signup verification steps)

                API restrictions

3. Legal & Ethical Considerations

        - Udemy's Terms of Service prohibit unauthorized scraping/automation.

        - This project is not affiliated with Udemy and should only be used for learning Selenium/automation concepts, and meet the technical test stage requirements for applying for a job

‚ö†Ô∏è Do not use this code to bypass Udemy's security measures or violate their terms.
